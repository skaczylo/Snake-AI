# Deep Q-Learning Snake

This repository attempts to apply Deep Q-Learning to the classic Snake game. The main goal is to learn and experiment with reinforcement learning techniques by training an agent to play Snake efficiently.

## Project Overview

- **Game Implementation:** The Snake game has been implemented from scratch using **Pygame**, allowing full control over game mechanics and environment.  
- **Initial Approach:** The agent is initially implemented and trained using **Deep Q-Learning**, a reinforcement learning technique that uses a neural network to approximate the Q-values of game states.  
- **Future Work:** The project aims to explore other reinforcement learning methods to compare their performance and efficiency in playing the Snake game. In particular, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).  

## Objectives

- Understand the process of training an agent using Deep Q-Learning.  
- Experiment with different network architectures and hyperparameters.  
- Compare various reinforcement learning techniques in the same environment.  
- Gain hands-on experience in integrating AI with game development using Pygame.
